Difference between methods and functions : 

Functions can be called only by its name, 
as it is defined independently. 

But methods canâ€™t be called by its name only, 
we need to invoke the class by a reference 
of that class in which it is defined,

i.e. method is defined within a class and 
hence they are dependent on that class.
